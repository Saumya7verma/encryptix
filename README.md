Developed an intelligent, multi-turn chatbot using Hugging Face’s FLAN-T5 large model for natural language understanding and generation.

Implemented long, coherent responses with controlled creativity using parameters like temperature, top-p sampling, and repetition penalty.

Added short-term memory to maintain context across multiple conversation turns for more human-like interactions.

Built in Python (Colab) with GPU acceleration for fast inference and scalability.

Demonstrated practical application of transformers, NLP, and AI deployment, making the project resume-ready and portfolio-worthy.
